<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hi, I'm Deepanshu Chaudhary, a B.Tech student at SRM University, Delhi NCR Campus, with a passion for learning and creativity. </p>

<p> I'm currently focusing on mastering Data Structures and Algorithms with full effort, as I strive to build a strong foundation in programming and aim to secure a great placement offer in a big tech company.</p>

<p>Outside academics, I love singing and am also learning to play the guitar, combining my love for music with self-expression. Fitness is important to me, and Iâ€™ve been consistent with my gym routine, aiming to stay healthy and disciplined. Being a vegetarian, I enjoy exploring nutritious yet simple meals. Whether it's studying, experimenting with tech, or pursuing my creative passions, I always aim to grow and give my best to everything I do.</p>
